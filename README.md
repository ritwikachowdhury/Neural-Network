# Neural-Network

This repository contains the ipython notebooks for the implementation of the perceptron algorithm and a fully connected neural network from scratch (without using any deep learning toolboxes).

Dataset:

For the perceptron algorithm , we have used hand designed data
For the FCNN, we have used MNIST data
